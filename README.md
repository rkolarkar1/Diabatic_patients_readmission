# Predicting-Hospital-Readmission-for-Diabetes-patients
Hospital readmission for diabetic patients is a major concern in the United States. This disease is chronic and does not have any specific cure. Hospital readmissions are expensive as hospitals face penalties if their readmission rate is higher than expected. This study attempts to identify the key factors that influence readmission for diabetes and to predict the probability of patient readmission.


Project Definition
